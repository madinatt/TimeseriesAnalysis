## Introduction

In this project, we delve into the analysis of historical stock market data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. We aim to gain a better understanding of stock price movements, identify potential investment opportunities, and evaluate the performance of various stocks.

## Dataset

Our analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset of historical stock prices. This dataset includes information about various stocks, their daily prices, trading volumes, and other relevant attributes. We provide details about the data source, its format, and any preprocessing steps applied in the repository.

## Analysis Objectives

Our primary objectives in this time series analysis include:

- Identifying trends and seasonality in stock prices.
- Predicting future stock prices using time series forecasting techniques.
- Analyzing the correlation between stock prices and external factors like economic indicators or news sentiment.
- Evaluating the performance of investment portfolios based on historical data.

## Methods and Tools

Our analysis employs a range of methods and tools, including:

- Time series decomposition and visualization.
- Time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn, heatmap).
- Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks.
- machine learning algorithms (e.g KNN, DTA).
